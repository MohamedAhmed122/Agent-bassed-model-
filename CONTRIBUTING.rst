Contributing
=========================

As an open source project, Mesa welcomes contributions of many forms.

In no particular order, examples include:

- Code patches
- Bug reports and patch reviews
- New features
- Documentation improvements
- Tutorials

No contribution is too small. Although, contributions can be too big, so let's discuss via the `dev email list`_ OR `an issue`_.

.. _`dev email list` : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/projectmesa-dev
.. _`an issue` : https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues

**To submit a contribution**

- Create a ticket for the item that you are working on.
- Fork the Mesa repository.
- `Clone your repository`_ from Github to your machine.
- Create a new branch in your fork: ``git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME``
- Install an editable version with developer requirements locally: ``pip install -e .[dev]``
- Edit the code. Save.
- Git add the new files and files with changes: ``git add FILE_NAME``
- Git commit your changes with a meaningful message: ``git commit -m "Fixes X issue."``
- If implementing a new feature, include some documentation in docs folder.
- Make sure that your submission passes the `Travis build`_. See "Testing and Standards below" to be able to run these locally.
- Make sure that your code is formatted according to `the black`_ standard (you can do it via `pre-commit`_). 
- Push your changes to your fork on Github: ``git push origin NAME_OF_BRANCH``.
- `Create a pull request`_.
- Describe the change w/ ticket number(s) that the code fixes.

Testing and Code Standards

As part of our contribution process, we practice continuous integration and use Travis to help enforce best practices.

If you're changing previous Mesa features, please make sure of the following:

- Your changes pass the current tests.
- Your changes pass our style standards.
- Your changes don't break the models or your changes include updated models.
- Additional features or rewrites of current features are accompanied by tests.
- New features are demonstrated in a model, so folks can understand more easily.

To ensure that your submission will not break the build, you will need to install Flake8 and pytest.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flake8 pytest pytest-cov

We test by implementing simple models and through traditional unit tests in the tests/ folder. The following only covers unit tests coverage. Ensure that your test coverage has not gone down. If it has and you need help, we will offer advice on how to structure tests for the contribution.

.. code-block:: bash

    py.test --cov=mesa tests/

With respect to code standards, we follow `PEP8`_ and the `Google Style Guide`_. We recommend to use `black`_ as an automated code formatter. You can automatically format your code using `pre-commit`_, which will prevent `git commit` of unstyled code and will automtically apply black style so you can immediately re-run `git commit`. To set up pre-commit run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install

You should no longer have to worry about code formatting. If still in doubt you may run the following command. If the command generates errors, fix all errors that are returned.

.. code-block:: bash

    flake8 . --ignore=F403,E501,E123,E128,W504,W503 --exclude=docs,build
